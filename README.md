## Installation
Need to run json server: http://localhost:3000/dogs to access data for the db.json file. 

## Usage
As a user, you can mouseover each dog image on the page and detail descriptions of the dog will display under the images. Also, upon clicking one of the images, the page background changes to a purple color, which in color psychology means: harmony, creativity, royalty, rarity, and healing. All those meanings are associated to positive emotions, invoking a positive association with the dog images being displayed and leading the users to want to adopt the dog and continue on to filling out the form below. The form will ask users to fill out basic information like: name, email, phone number, and select a dog from the dropdown menu. Upon filling out the form and submitting the form with the button looking icon, "Continue Adoption", a brief message will appear on the page with the text: "Thank you for your interest! We will get back to you soon." to notify the user that the form was successfully submitted and they will hear back soon.
